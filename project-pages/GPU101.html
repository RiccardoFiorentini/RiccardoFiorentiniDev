            The algorithm of Gauss-Seidel is notoriously serial and trades on iteration to solve 
          problems like linear systems of equations. In particular, the variant to implement has a 
          backward part where the algorithm is the same but starting from the last row instead of the first one, 
          flipping all the dependencies. Many attempts to find a way to parallelize this algorithm use the 
          Jacobi method as an approximation. Consequentially it needs more cycles to find a result of the 
          same precision. The advantage of sparse matrixes is that computing everything in sequence is unnecessary. 
          It is possible to find independent groups of rows computable in parallel using algorithms based on a graph-coloring approach. 
          These analyses, therefore, have a computational cost that we can not neglect. The aim is to create a lighter program 
          that does not need preprocessing of data and can do the independent operations in parallel using the same input of
          the serial CPU implementation.
