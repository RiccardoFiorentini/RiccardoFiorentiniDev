              <div class="body-text">Nanoparticles (NPs) are being increasingly utilized in advanced industries, offering unique and enhanced properties that have significant commercial and societal value. To ensure reliable performance and meet regulatory requirements, it is crucial to accurately measure the number concentration of particles in colloidal suspensions. This measurement holds immense importance for industries such as personal care, fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and biomedicine, as it enables material optimization, specification, design, and quality control.</div>
              <div class="body-text">However, despite the growing demand for high-performance nanoparticles, there is a lack of formal evaluation and validation of the techniques employed for measuring NP number concentration. Furthermore, the absence of certified reference materials for calibration exacerbates the situation. Inaccurate handling of samples, including precipitation, particle agglomeration, and improper dilution procedures, can introduce errors into the measurements, making it essential to disseminate best practices within the measurement community.</div>
              <div class="body-text">To address these pressing needs, the European project 14IND12 Innanopart, part of the European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research (EMPIR), has been established. This project aims to develop reliable methods for NP number concentration measurements with an expanded uncertainty of better than 10% and establish metrological traceability to the SI unit.</div>
              <div class="body-text">Innanopart has identified Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) and single particle Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (spICPMS) as the traceable methods for NP number concentration measurements. Additionally, the project is investigating several laboratory methods, including UV-Vis spectrometry, Centrifugal Liquid Sedimentation (CLS), and Particle Tracking Analysis (PTA), as part of the VAMAS study.</div>
              <div class="body-text">The VAMAS study, organized within the Innanopart project, is expected to yield valuable outcomes that will lay the groundwork for the development of relevant standard documentation. These standards are crucial for industries that rely on high-performance nanoparticles, as they ensure quality, reliability, and compliance with regulations.</div>
              <div class="body-text">In summary, the accurate measurement of NP number concentration is vital for industries utilizing nanoparticles, and the Innanopart project is working diligently to address the existing challenges. Through the development of reliable measurement methods and the establishment of international standards, Innanopart aims to provide industries with the necessary tools to optimize materials, ensure product reliability, and enable compliance with regulations and safety standards.</div>
