          Developed a GPU-based implementation of the Pair-HMM forward algorithm
                boosting flexibility by removing input limits and achieving a remarkable speedup
                of over 5 times compared to existing methods. Recognized for excellence, the
                project was accepted for the "Best Student Research Video & Poster Competition"

            In the personalized medicine domain, genome
            analysis is crucial to highlight genetic variants and provide
            customized treatments to each patient. HaplotypeCaller, developed by the Broad Institute, represents the de-facto standard
            tool for variant identification and relies on the Pair-HMM
            algorithm. However, HaplotypeCaller's analyses require long
            execution times due to a bottleneck represented by the Pair-HMM. Moreover, given this algorithmâ€™s compute-intensiveness,
            general-purpose CPUs exacerbate this limitation. Thus, offloading it to hardware accelerators is a suitable solution to speed up
            the execution. However, the performance achieved by State-ofthe-Art works comes with constraints on flexibility, jeopardizing
            their usability. This project aims at accelerating the PairHMM algorithm on GPU, incorporating various optimizations
            to address the computational challenges and overcome the issues
            of the currently-available solutions.
